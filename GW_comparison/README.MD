# GW Comparisons
This directory contains data from [Yu and Zunger's 2012 paper](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.068701) in which they introduce the SLME metric. We compare the band-gaps they calculated at a GW level to the PBE band-gaps from the Forbidden Transitions (FT) dataset from [Woods-Robinson et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590238523003545#abs0015) and the PBE & HSE06 band-gaps from [Kim et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00723-8) We also compare the GW band-gaps (and Delta E, defined as the difference between the minimum dipole allowed gap and the minimum gap) to predictions using the ML models trained in this work.
