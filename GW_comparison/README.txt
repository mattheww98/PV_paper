This directory contains data from Yu and Zunger's 2012 paper in which they introduce the SLME metric. We compare the band-gaps they calculated at a GW level to the PBE band-gaps from the Forbidden Transitions (FT) dataset from Woods-Robinson et al. and the PBE & HSE06 band-gaps from Kim et al. We also compare the GW band-gaps (and Delta E, defined as the difference between the minimum dipole allowed gap and the minimum gap) to predictions using the ML models trained in this work.
