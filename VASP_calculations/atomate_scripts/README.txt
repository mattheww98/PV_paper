This directory contains CIFs and ATOMATE2 python scripts to run a variety of VASP calculations with a variety of photovoltaics.This can be used in tandem with codecarbon to track the energy cost of such calculations. Integrating codecarbon within ATOMATE2 to automate this process is complicated, so in practice we re-ran some VASP calculations that ATOMATE2 had run with a codecarbon wrapper, then used used a linear fit to extrapolate energy costs from the CPU time in the VASP OUTCAR files for the remaining calculations. The carbon_vasp.py script runs codecarbon while executing the VASP run command in the VASP_run.sh executable.
