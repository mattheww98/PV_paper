This directory contains all input files (divided into directories for each property) for each property that we have used ML models to predict. The properties_results.ipynb notebook processes the results and produces the plots seen in the paper. The true_values directory contains the test data, against which the ML inferences are compared to assess the performance of each model. The train_files directory contains scripts to train the ALIGNN ML model, with separate scripts for scalar and vectorial/spectral data. The train.py script has a codecarbon wrapper so that an emissions.csv file will be produced, indicating the energy usedby the GPU and CPU in training. The test_files contains the test data and a script to run a forward pass of a trained model i.e. predicting the properties of an input set of material structures. There is also an example file for monitoring the energy usage of the inference process.
